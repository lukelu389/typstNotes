*Demand*: want, but you have the money & will 100% spend the money if someone offers to sell at that price you Demand

  - What are the things that affect demand?
   - Price of the good $P$
   - Price of other goods $P_o$
   - Information: (i.e. monetary policies) $I$
   - Purchasing power of consumers $M$
   - Government policy $G$

The equation of $q_d$, quantity demanded:
$ q_d = -P +P_o + I + M -G $

Graphical representation:


where $q_d$ is on the $x$-axis and $P$ on $y$-axis

If another variable changed and we can obtain the new change in $q_d$, results in a shift of the curve to left or right.

Changes however on $P$ will be along the curve.

The slope of demand curve is given by the coefficient in front of $P$ and it tells us the elasticity of demand $->$sensitivity of demand to price.

(i.e. $q_d = 100-P $)
