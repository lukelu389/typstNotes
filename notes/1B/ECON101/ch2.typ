#info[*Definition*\

*Demand*: want, but you have the money & will 100% spend the money if someone offers to sell at that price you demand

  - What affects demand?
   - Price of the good $P$
   - Price of other goods $P_o$
   - Information: (i.e. monetary policies) $I$
   - Purchasing power of consumers $M$
   - Government policy $G$

The equation of $q_d$, quantity demanded:
$ q_d = -P + P_o + I + M -G $

Graphical representation:


where $q_d$ is on the $x$-axis and $P$ on $y$-axis

If another variable changed and we can obtain the new change in $q_d$, results in a shift of the curve to left or right.

Changes however on $P$ will be along the curve.
]

(i.e. $q_d = 100-P $)

#warn[While solving for the slope, the traditional method of slope mathematically is reciprocal of the graphical representation of the economic model]

#info[*Supply*\

Supply is a measure of how much a market will produce with certainty at any price.

- What affects supply?
  - Price $P$
  - Price of other goods $P_o$
    - Input materials
    - Other things could have instead produced
  - Government Intervention $G$


Equaiton $ q_s = P - P_o + G $

where $q_s$ is the quantity supply.
]

(i.e. $q_s = P$)

A positive in government intervention shifts the graph to the right whereas to the left


#tip[*Elasticity*\

The slope of each curve is given by the coefficient in front of $P$ and it tells us the elasticity of demand $->$sensitivity to price.]

#info[*The Law of Demand*

All else constant, an increase in price causes a decrease in demand 

$-->$ coefficient of price in the $q_d$ function will always be negative 

$-->$ demand curve will always be downward sloping
]

#info[*The Law of Supply*\

All else constant, an increase inprice causes an increase in supply

$-->$ coefficient of price in the $q_s$ function will always positive

$-->$ supply curve will always be upward sloping
