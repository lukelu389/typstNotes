1. Equation
  - $M =$ income
  - $p_i =$ price for product $i$
  - $q_ =$ quantity for product $i$

  $ M =  p_1 q_1+p_2 q_2 $

  $-->$ $M$ is the amount of money allocated for this specific decision

  Note that the goal is to gain the most amount of happiness from the given budget.

  Area below the curve is the Inefficient distribution of budget.

  On the line suggests the optimial distribution of budget.

  The slope $(p_2) / p_1$: good 2 costs $frac(p_2, p_1)$ good 1 $==>$ opportunity costs

  Orange: original line\
  Green: $p_2$ decreases\
  RedL $p_2$ increases\
  Black: $M$ increases
