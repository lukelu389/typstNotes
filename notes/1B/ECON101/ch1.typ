Economics: the study of what, how, and for whom

At the core of microeconomics is the idea that people act in their own self-interest, and that these individual choices—through markets—often lead to efficient outcomes.

However, markets are not always perfect. Government intervention is justified when it can improve overall efficiency or correct market failures, but it should be designed carefully so that it does not unnecessarily distort individual incentives or self-interest.

Finally, an outcome is said to be in the social interest when it maximizes the well-being of society as a whole, not just individual gains.
