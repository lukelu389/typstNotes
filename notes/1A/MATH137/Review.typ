1. $lim_(x->oo) frac(sin x, x) =^("Squeeze Thm") 0 $

2. $(ln 2)' = 0$ 

3. $dvs(f^(-1) (2), x) = 1/(f'(f^(-1)(1))) = 1/4$

4. $0^0$ is a indeterminate form is True

5. $x^(1/x) ==> f'(x) = e^((1-ln x)/x^2) = 0 ==> x = e==> f(e) = e^(1/e)$

6. If $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ as the same second derivative, then $f(x)-g(x)= B x+ C$ for some $B, C in RR$

7. If $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are not differentiable at $x=a$, but $f(x)g(x)$ might be differentiable. i.e. $"sgn"(x) dot |x| = x$

8. Graph of $y=x^2/3$ is not concave up. $f''(x) = -2/9 x^(-4/3) <= 0 space forall x in RR$ except at $x=0$ as not differentiable

9. The derivative of implicit curve $x^2+6x+2y^2+3y +11 = 0$ which is DNE: \
  $(x+3)^2 + 2(y^2+3y/2+9/16)+14/16 != 0$

10. If $f(x)=a x^2 + b x + c$ then $|f(x)-L_p ^f (x)|<=a(x-p)^2$

  Note that $M = 2a ==> (2a)/2 (x-p)^2$ 

11. Bounded Derivative Theorem
