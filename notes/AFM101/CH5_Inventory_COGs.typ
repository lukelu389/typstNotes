== I. Financial Statements for Merchandising Companies

*Key differences from service companies*
- *Balance Sheet:* Merchandising companies report *Inventory* as a *Current Asset* (a “somewhat liquid” asset).
- *Income Statement:* Includes *Sales Revenue*, *Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)*, and *Gross Profit* (Gross Margin).
  - $ text("Gross Profit") = text("Sales Revenue") - text("Cost of Goods Sold") $
  - *COGS* is classified as an *expense*.

*Merchandise inventory fundamentals*
- *Inventory:* Cost of inventory still on hand; *Asset* on the Balance Sheet.
- *Cost of Goods Sold (COGS):* Cost of inventory that has been sold; *Expense* on the Income Statement.

*Determining inventory cost*

$text("Inventory Cost")
= text("Basic Purchase Price")
+ text("Freight-in, insurance in transit, and ready-to-sell costs")
- text("Returns, allowances, and discounts")$


*Goods in transit (shipping terms)* — determines who owns inventory while shipped.


== II. Perpetual Inventory System (LO 1)

*Characteristics*
- Used for all types of goods.
- Keeps a *running total* of goods bought, sold, and on hand.
- Often uses bar codes to record sales and update inventory automatically.

*Recording inventory transactions*


*Calculations*
- $text("Net Purchases") = text("Purchase Price") + text("Freight-in") - text("Purchase Returns") - text("Purchase Allowances") - text("Purchase Discounts") $
- $text("Net Sales") = text("Sales Revenue") - text("Sales Returns and Allowances") - text("Sales Discounts") $

*Sales adjustments (returns and discounts)*
1. *Sales Returns & Allowances:* If returns are expected, record:
   - *Accrued liability:* *Sales Refund Payable* for sales price of expected returns.
   - *Asset adjustment:* *Estimated Inventory Returns* to adjust inventory and COGS for expected returns.
   - *Example (both price & cost effects):*  
     - Price side: Debit *Cash/A/R*; Credit *Sales Revenue* & *Sales Refund Payable*.  
     - Cost side: Debit *COGS* & *Inventory Returns Estimated*; Credit *Inventory*.
2. *Sales Discounts:* e.g., *2/10, n/30* → 2% discount if paid within 10 days; otherwise net in 30 days.  
   - If buyer takes the discount, *Sales Discounts* is *debited*.

== III. Inventory Costing Methods (LO 2)

*Purpose:* Determine *COGS* (income statement) and *Ending Inventory* (balance sheet).

1. *Specific Identification:* Unique items (e.g., automobiles, antiques). Each unit at its specific cost.
2. *FIFO (First-in, First-out):*
   - Assumes *oldest* items are sold first.
   - Ending inventory is the *most recent* costs.
3. *Weighted-Average Cost:* Uses average cost of all units available during the period for sales and ending inventory.

*Impact when inventory costs are increasing*
