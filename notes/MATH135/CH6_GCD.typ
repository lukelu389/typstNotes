== Greatest Common Divisor

\
Let $a "and" b$ be integer. An integer $c$ is called a *common divisor* of $a "and" b "if" c divides a "and" c divides b$

If $a$ and $b$ are not both zero, an integer $d > 0$ is the *greatest common divisor* of $a$ and be written $d = gcd(a, b)$, when

1. $d$ is a common divisor of $a$ and $b$
2. $forall$ integers $c$, if $c$ is a common divisor of $a$ and $b$, then $c <= d$

If $a$ and $b$ are both zero, we define $gcd(a, b) = gcd(0, 0) = 0$

#warn[Let $a in ZZ$ then
  1. $gcd(a, a) = |a|$

Example: \

Let $a, b in ZZ$, prove that $gcd(3a+b, a) = gcd(a, b)$

#proof[
  Let $a, b in ZZ$, let $c = gcd(3a+b, a) "and" d = gcd(a, b)$.\

  1. Suppose $a, b$ are not both 0: \

  Note that $3a+b "and" a$ are not both 0 as well. \

  Then $c divides (3a+b), c divides a$ and $forall k in ZZ$ if $k$ is a common divisor of $3a+b$ and $a$, then $k <= c, c > 0$\

  Similarly, $d divides a, d divides b, "and" forall l in ZZ$ if $l$ is a common divisor of $a$ and $b$ then $l<=d, d >0$ \

  Notice that since $d divides a "and" d divides b$, by DIC, $d divides (3a+b)$.\
  This tells us that $d$ is a common divisor of $3a+b$ and $a$. By definition, $d <= c$. \

  Since $c divides (3a+b)$ and $c divides a$, then by DIC, $c divides ((3a+b)+(-3a)) = c divides b$. \
  Thus $c$ is a common divisor of $a$ and $b$. By definition, $c <= d$

  Since $c <= d "and" d <= c ==> c = d ==> gcd(3a+b, a) = gcd(a, b)$

  2. Suppose $a = b = 0$ then $gcd(3a+b, a) = gcd(a, b) = gcd(0, 0) = 0$

Euclidean algorithm example: \

1. Compute $gcd(1239, 735)$\
$ 1239 = 1 dot 735 + 504 $ \
GCDWR says $gcd(1239, 735) = gcd(735, 504)$\
$ 735 = 1 dot 504 + 231 $ \
$gcd(735, 504) = gcd(504, 231)$ \
$ 504 = 2 dot 231 + 42 $ \
$gcd(504, 231) = gcd(231, 42)$ \
$ 231 = 5 dot 42 + 21 $\
$gcd(231, 42) = gcd(42, 21)$ \
$ 42 = 2 dot 21 + 0 $ \
$gcd(42, 21) = gcd(21, 0)$ \
$ therefore gcd(1239, 735) = 21 $\

\
2. Find $x, y in ZZ$ s.t. $1239 x+735 y = 21$\
We work backwards from the previous example\

$ 21 = 5 dot 42 + 21 $
$ 21 = 231 - 5 dot (504 - 2 dot 231) $
$ = 11(231) - 5 dot 504 $
$ = 11 dot 735 - 16 dot 504 $
$ = 11 dot 735 - 16 (1239 - 735) $

$ = -16 dot 1239 + 27 dot 735 $
$therefore -16 dot 1239 + 27 dot 735 = 21$

]

Example:\
Let $n in ZZ$. Prove that $gcd(n, n+1) = 1$ \
Option 1: Use the definition of GCD\

Option 2: Use GCD Characterization Theorem\
Let $a = n, b = n+1, d = 1$.\

$d divides a "and" d divides b$ because $d=1$ divides every integer\
Let $s =-1, t = 1$ \
These will be provide the certificate of correctness to verify that $d = 1$ is the GCD we are looking for.

$a s + b t = n(-1) + (n+1) 1 = 1$ \
$therefore "by GCD CT" 1 = gcd(n, n+1)$

Option 3: Use GCDWR\
$n+1 = 1 dot n + 1$

So $gcd(56, 35) = 7$. According to EEA, $s = x_5 = 2$ and $t = y_5 = -3$ are certificate of correctness\

So $gcd(408, 170) = 34$. According to EEA, $s = x_4 = -2$ and $t = y_4 = 5$ are certificate of correctness\

Check $408 (-2) + 170(5) = 34$ which is true

Examples:\

1. Prove $forall a, b, c, in ZZ$, if $gcd(a b, c) = 1, "then" gcd(a, c) = gcd(b, c) = 1$

#proof[
  Let $a, b, c in ZZ$. Assume that $gcd(a b, c) = 1$.\
  By BL, $exists s, t in ZZ$ s.t. $a b dot s + c dot t = 1$\
  $a (b s) + c t = 1$ \
  $b(a s) + c t = 1$ \
  Since $a, b, s, t in ZZ, b s in ZZ "and" a s in ZZ$, 1 can be expressed as an integer combination of $a$ and $c$, as well as an integer combination of $b$ and $c$.\
  Meanwhile, 1 is clearly a common divisor of $a, c$ and $b, c$. Since $1 divides x forall z in ZZ$. \
  $therefore "By GCDCT", gcd(a, b) = 1 "and" gcd(b, c) = 1$

#proof[
  We will prove that the open setnence $P(n):$ the number $n$ can be wirtten as a product of primes is true for all naturanl numbers $n>$ 1 by strong induction. \

  Base case: $n=2 ==> 2=2$, so $P(2)$ is true. \

  Induction Step: \
  Let $k in NN, k >= 2$, assume that $P(2) and P(3) and ... and P(k)$ is true. That is $forall i in 2, ..., k, i$ can be expressed as a product of primes.\
  Consider $k+1$: \
  If $k+1$ is prime, then $k+1$ is already a product of primes, so $P(k+1)$ is true. \
  If $k+1$ is composite, meaning $exists s, r in NN$ with $2<=s, r < k+1 ==> 2 <= s, r <= k$ s.t. $k+1 = r dot s$. By I.H., both $s, r$ can be written as a product or primes. That is $P(k+1)$is true. \
  By Principle of Strong Induciton, $P(n)$ is true $forall n in NN, n >= 2$
