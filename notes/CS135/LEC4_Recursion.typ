= From “...” to Recursion

*Goal:* Formalize computations that math often writes with ellipses (“…”).

*Example — Sum to n*  
Let f(n) be the sum of natural numbers up to n. Observe:
- f(n) = f(n − 1) + n
- Base: f(0) = 0

*Direct Racket translation (Nat recursion with zero?/sub1):*
```racket
;; sum-to: Nat -> Nat
(define (sum-to n)
  (cond [(zero? n) 0]
        [else (+ n (sum-to (sub1 n)))]))

(require rackunit)
(check-expect (sum-to 4) 10)
(check-expect (sum-to 8) 36)
(check-expect (sum-to 13) 91)
(check-expect (sum-to 0) 0)
```

*Key ideas:*  
- A *recursive function* calls itself with a “smaller” argument until a *base case*.  
- For Naturals in this course: “smaller” = `sub1`, base test = `zero?`.

#note[
*The “Tripod” of Computation (Turing completeness in our model):*  
1) Arbitrarily large numbers • 2) Conditionals • 3) Recursion.
]

= Rules for Recursion (version 1)

1) *Change exactly one argument* closer to termination on the recursive call.  
2) For Naturals: *use `sub1`* and test termination with *`zero?`*.

*Template for Natural-number recursion:*
```racket
(define (natural-template n)
  (cond
    [(zero? n) ...]          ; base case result
    [else (... n ... (natural-template (sub1 n)))]) ; use n and recur on (sub1 n)
)
```

#tip[
*Three properties to watch:*  
- *Termination:* Guaranteed by shrinking the Nat with `sub1` until `zero?`.  
- *Correctness:* In CS135 we lean on tests (you could also prove by induction).  
- *Efficiency:* Measured by *stepper* (count substitution steps).

= Names & Scope

- *Scope* = where an identifier (function/parameter/constant) has effect.  
- Two kinds for now: *global* and *function* scope.  
- The *smallest enclosing scope* takes priority.  
- *Duplicate identifiers in same scope → error*:
```racket
(define f 3)
(define (f x) (sqr x)) ; error: f already defined as a value
```
- DrRacket has *scope tools* to visualize where names refer.
= Our 5-Step Design Pattern

1) *Purpose*: Write what the function produces/consumes.  
2) *Contract & Header*: Types (kinds) and parameter names.  
3) *Examples/Tests*: Work by hand; include boundary cases.  
4) *Body from Template*: Start with the recursion template, fill in specifics.  
5) *More Tests*: Add any missing edge/coverage tests.

== Worked Example — Factorial

*Math idea:* n! = n·(n − 1)! with base 0! = 1 (by convention).

*Definition (Nat recursion):*
```racket
;; factorial: Nat -> Nat
;; Produce n!
(define (factorial n)
  (cond
    [(zero? n) 1]
    [else (* n (factorial (sub1 n)))]))

(require rackunit)
(check-expect (factorial 3) 6)
(check-expect (factorial 5) 120)
(check-expect (factorial 7) 5040)
(check-expect (factorial 0) 1)
(check-expect (factorial 1) 1)
```

*Variant with a shorter name:*
```racket
;; !: Nat -> Nat
(define (! n)
  (cond
    [(zero? n) 1]
    [else (* n (! (sub1 n)))]))
```

#warn[
Common mistakes:  
- Changing *multiple* arguments on the recursive call (breaks our v1 rules).  
- Missing or incorrect *base case* (non-terminating or wrong result).  
- Forgetting to *use `n` in the step* (e.g., summing/multiplying the wrong thing).
