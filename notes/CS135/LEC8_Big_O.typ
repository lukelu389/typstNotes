== List Abbreviations
`(list 1 2 3)` is shorthand for `(cons 1 (cons 2 (cons 3 empty)))`.

== Counting Steps → Big-O
Measure time by the *number of substitutions*. For linear list recursion, steps ∝ list length `n`.

Linear example:
```racket
(define (len lst)
  (cond [(empty? lst) 0]
        [else (add1 (len (rest lst)))]))
```
#note[Built-ins like `length`, `append`, and `reverse` should be treated as *linear* in the size of their input lists for complexity reasoning.]

== Spotting Quadratic Work
```racket
(define (rev-bad xs)              ; quadratic: uses append each step
  (cond [(empty? xs) empty]
        [else (append (rev-bad (rest xs)) (list (first xs)))]))
```

== Exercises
1. Classify the complexity of `map`, `filter`, `increasing?`, `insert`.  
2. Rewrite `rev-bad` using an accumulator to get linear time.
